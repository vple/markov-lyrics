Welcome to the jungle we got fun and games
We got everything you want honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money honey we got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I,I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see you'll take it eventually
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
I'm gonna watch you plead

And when you're high you never ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby, you gonna dieee
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my my serpentine
Jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
Down in the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to you
It's gonna bring you down, ha!!
