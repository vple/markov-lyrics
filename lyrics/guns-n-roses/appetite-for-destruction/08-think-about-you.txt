Say baby you been lookin' real good
I remember when we met
Funny how it never felt so good
It's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
Ooh it was the best time
I can remember
Ooh and the love we shared
is lovin' that'll last forever

There wasn't much
in this heart of mine
There was a little left
and babe you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
Ooh it was the best thing
I can remember
Ooh and the love we shared
is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you
Honey all the time
my heart says yes
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darlin' you're the only one
I think about you

Somethin' changed
in this heart of mine
An' I'm so glad that ya showed me
Funny how I never felt so high
It's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
Ooh it was the best time
I can remember
Ooh and the love we shared
is lovin' that'll last forever
